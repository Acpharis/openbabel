The projects in this workspace are intended for Visual C++6.
It is probable that they will be automatically converted by Visual Studio.NET

-------------------------
Standalone EXE files
-------------------------
OBabel
This produces the command line program obabel.exe by compiling all the core OpenBabel files, the conversion files, obconversion.cpp and a number of format files.If more format files become available, just add them to the compilation, no othercode changes are necessary. This does not need any other files to run.OBGUIsThis produces a statically linked Windows interface and does not require any other files to run.  It handles the formats included during its compilation. Others can be added by including their cpp files during the build.
 
-------------------------
Dynamic link libraries
-------------------------
OBDLL
This makes obdll.dll from the files in the OpenBabel core API.  It does not include any input/output capability.

OBConv
This makes obconv.dll which contains the I/O routines and can recognize format files,*.obf (which are DLLs).

------------------------
EXE files using DLLs
------------------------
OBConsole
This makes a version of babel.exe which links with obconv.lib and needs obconv.dll, obdll.dll and one or more format files, *.obf, at runtime.

OBGUI
This makes OBGUI.exe which links with obconv.lib and needs obconv.dll, obdll.dll and one or more format files, *.obf, at runtime.

OBFormats2
Makes OBFormats2.obf which contains the majority of the currently available formats.  

OBExtraFormats
Makes OBExtra.obf containing FingerprintFormat, FastSearchFormat, InChIFormat and TestFormat.
Uses libinchi.dll.

OBXMLFormats
Makes CMLFormat, CMLReactFormat, PubChemFormat and XMLFormat.
Uses libxml2.dll.

ProgramTest
This uses prog1.cpp to illustrate a command line program using the OB API and I/Ocapabilities in DLLs. It links with obconv.lib and obdll.lib and needs obconv.dll, obdll.dll and one or more format files, *.obf, at runtime. Alternatively it wouldhave been possible to build prog1.cpp with all the files in the OBabel project exceptmain.cpp.

ProgramTest2
This example shows how to add automatic format conversion to an existing Windows programusing the DLL form of OpenBabel. It does not need mol.h to compile, but does need obconv.dll, obdll.dll and one or more format files, *.obf, at runtime.
